# SmartSpend Design System

A modern, accessible, and scalable design system built for exceptional user experiences.

## Philosophy

This design system draws inspiration from Apple's precision, Linear's clarity, and Notion's flexibility. It prioritizes:

- **Clarity**: Every element has purpose and hierarchy
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliant by default
- **Consistency**: Predictable patterns across all touchpoints
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and smooth interactions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography

# Import the design system
import '@/design-system/tokens.css'
```

## Structure

- [`/tokens`](./tokens/) - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- [`/components`](./components/) - Component specifications
- [`/patterns`](./patterns/) - Common UI patterns
- [`/guidelines`](./guidelines/) - Usage guidelines and best practices

## Core Principles

1. **Mobile-first**: Design scales up from mobile to desktop
2. **Theme-aware**: Native light/dark mode support
3. **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers, sufficient contrast
4. **Performant**: Minimal footprint, optimized animations
